This software `stable-mir-json` compiles a Rust program and extracts the
middle intermediate representation (MIR) from the compiler.
The extracted MIR is saved in a file as self-contained JSON data so that
Rust verification and inspection tools can provide insight into the 
program's inner workings and behaviour.
