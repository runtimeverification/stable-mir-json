# Session Transcript - Rustc Upgrade to Latest Nightly

## Session Details
- **Date**: 2025-07-18
- **Agent**: Claude Sonnet 4 (Background Agent)
- **Task**: Workflow 1 "Initialize" - Upgrade stable-mir-json to depend on most recent nightly rustc version
- **Problem**: Upgrade stable-mir-json from nightly-2024-11-29 to most recent nightly version
- **Session Directory**: cursor-data/20250718-rustc-upgrade

## Prompt 1

**User Prompt:**
```
The file `cursor-data/instructions.md` contains detailed instructions for agent-based development in this repository. We are going to perform workflow 1 "Initialize" as described in the instructions.md file, to solve the following problem:

Upgrade the stable-mir-json software to depend on rustc in the most recent nightly version

More details: 
Workflow 1 is for initializing a develoment, and the outcome is an implementation plan and possible risks and caveats of different approaches to solving the problem.
The release channel for nightly versions is described in https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/channels.html.
Currently, stable-mir-json depends on the nightly version "nightly-2024-11-29" (as per the rust-toolchain.toml file)
The code in stable-mir-json is expected to require an unknown amount of changes as a result of many changes to rustc which happened in the meanwhile, both in the stable_mir crate which is extensively used and in other parts of the compiler relating to the MIR (middle-intermediate representation). The goal of this change is to replicate the exact same behaviour as before for stable-mir-json 
As also mentioned in the instructions, please create a  session directory `cursor-data/20250718-rustc-upgrade` and a file `session.md` inside it which retains the exact prompts given and short summaries of the agent's responses. See `cursor-data/20250718-docs/session.md` for an example of such a session transcript.
The implementation plan  produced by the workflow should be saved in a separate single file in the session directory.
```

**Agent Response Summary:**
- Read instructions.md to understand workflow 1 "Initialize" requirements
- Analyzed repository structure and current dependencies (rust-toolchain.toml shows nightly-2024-11-29)
- Examined background knowledge documents (goals.md, design.md, requirements.md) to understand stable-mir-json purpose and architecture
- Researched current Rust nightly versions and found significant releases through 2025 (1.85.0-1.88.0, latest 1.88.0 released June 26, 2025)
- Created session directory cursor-data/20250718-rustc-upgrade/ with session.md transcript
- Identified that stable-mir-json is a compiler driver that extracts MIR data to JSON using rustc's stable_mir API
- Found extensive usage of stable_mir throughout the codebase (driver.rs, printer.rs, mk_graph.rs)
- Analyzed current implementation using rustc_private crates: rustc_driver, rustc_interface, rustc_middle, rustc_session, rustc_smir, rustc_span, rustc_monomorphize
- Identified critical dependency on rustc_internal bridge for stable/internal API conversion
- Examined existing test structure and failing tests to understand current stability issues
- Determined target nightly version should be approximately nightly-2025-07-17 based on recent stable releases
- **Created comprehensive implementation plan** covering:
  * 5-phase approach (Setup → Core API Migration → Data Extraction → Testing → Documentation)
  * Risk assessment with high-probability breaking changes in stable_mir API and rustc_internal bridge
  * 7-12 day timeline estimate with 60-70% confidence
  * Alternative approaches (incremental vs. direct upgrade)
  * Success criteria and mitigation strategies
  * Technical and knowledge dependencies
- Saved detailed implementation plan in cursor-data/20250718-rustc-upgrade/implementation_plan.md

## Prompt 2

**User Prompt:**
```
Let's refine the sections:
* For the problem analysis section: If possible, add web links to background information or rustc source code changes for all risks mentioned in the implementation plan, but at least for all high-risk items
* For the problem analysis section: if possible, make a summary of all key changes that were made to the core dependencies enumerated in the document
* For the implementation plan, expect nightly 2025-07-17 and pre-determine availability of the artefacts 
```

**Agent Response Summary:**
- Researched specific rustc and stable_mir API changes between nightly-2024-11-29 and 2025-07-17
- Enhanced Problem Analysis section with web links to relevant documentation and source code changes:
  * Added links to Stable MIR Project, Kani StableMIR Migration Guide, and specific rustc PRs
  * Included LLVM integration changes, MIR optimization passes, and type system evolution references
  * Added documentation for breaking changes in rustc_smir API surface
- Created comprehensive summary of key changes to core dependencies:
  * stable_mir: Method signature evolution, new type abstractions, enhanced safety guarantees
  * rustc_smir: Bridge API refinements, conversion pattern changes, error handling improvements
  * rustc_middle: MIR node type updates, metadata structure changes, optimization integration
  * rustc_hir: Type inference updates, trait resolution changes, lifetime analysis improvements
  * Build system: Feature gate evolution, version constraint updates, component dependency changes
- Updated Implementation Approach to expect nightly-2025-07-17 specifically:
  * Pre-determined artifact availability expectations and verification steps
  * Added rustup component installation verification procedures
  * Included fallback options if 2025-07-17 unavailable
  * Enhanced environment setup with specific toolchain validation
- Verified current nightly availability and updated timeline estimates
- Maintained comprehensive risk assessment with enhanced technical detail and mitigation strategies

## Prompt 3

**User Prompt:**
```
Please update the session.md file with the previous prompt (and this prompt, too). The session.md file should only be appended to, not modifying existing text.
```

**Agent Response Summary:**
- Appended new prompt and response entries to session.md file without modifying existing content
- Maintained consistent formatting and structure of session transcript
- Documented the refinement process including addition of web links, dependency change summaries, and nightly version specification
- Preserved complete record of workflow 1 "Initialize" session for future reference
