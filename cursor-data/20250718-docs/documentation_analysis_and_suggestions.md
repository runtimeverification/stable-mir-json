# Analysis and Improvement Suggestions for stable-mir-json Documentation

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the `stable-mir-json` codebase, README.md, and existing documentation in `cursor-data/`, I've identified several areas where the documentation could be significantly enhanced to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the software's purpose, design, and requirements.

## Current State Analysis

### What stable-mir-json Does

`stable-mir-json` is a Rust compiler driver that:
- Intercepts the compilation process of Rust programs
- Extracts the Middle Intermediate Representation (MIR) using Rust's stable_mir API
- Serializes the MIR data into self-contained JSON format
- Optionally generates GraphViz dot files for visual representation
- Provides cargo integration for seamless use in Rust projects

### Key Components Identified

1. **Driver Module** (`src/driver.rs`): Compiler hook mechanism
2. **Printer Module** (`src/printer.rs`): JSON serialization with SmirJson data structure
3. **Graph Module** (`src/mk_graph.rs`): GraphViz dot file generation
4. **Cargo Integration** (`src/bin/cargo_stable_mir_json.rs`): Cargo project integration
5. **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive integration tests with JSON normalization

# Goals of stable-mir-json

## Primary Purpose
This software `stable-mir-json` compiles a Rust program and extracts the
middle intermediate representation (MIR) from the compiler.
The extracted MIR is saved in a file as self-contained JSON data so that
Rust verification and inspection tools can provide insight into the 
program's inner workings and behaviour.

## Use Cases and Applications

### Program Analysis and Verification
- **Static Analysis Tools**: Provide structured MIR data for tools that analyze Rust programs for safety, security, and correctness
- **Formal Verification**: Enable verification tools like Creusot, Prusti, or KANI to work with standardized MIR representations
- **Security Auditing**: Allow security researchers to examine the compiled representation of Rust code for vulnerability analysis

### Development and Debugging
- **Compiler Education**: Help developers understand how Rust code is represented internally after compilation
- **Performance Analysis**: Enable analysis of optimization decisions and code structure at the MIR level
- **Debug Information**: Provide detailed insights into how high-level Rust constructs are lowered to MIR

### Research and Tooling
- **Academic Research**: Support research into programming language semantics, compiler optimizations, and program analysis
- **Tool Development**: Serve as a foundation for building new Rust analysis and transformation tools
- **Cross-compilation Analysis**: Understand target-specific compilation differences through MIR examination

## Target Audience
- Rust verification tool developers
- Compiler researchers and educators
- Security analysts working with Rust programs
- Tool builders requiring access to Rust's internal representations
- Academic researchers studying programming language implementation
```

# Design Architecture of stable-mir-json

## Overview
The software `stable-mir-json` consists of Rust code that links to a specific
nightly version of the Rust compiler `rustc`.
The software has a small driver program `driver.rs` which executes the Rust compiler
(with all provided options) and meanwhile calls a specific _hook_ in the compiler
to extract the Middle Intermediate Representation (MIR) into a self-contained JSON file.

## Core Architecture

### Compiler Integration Strategy
- **Rustc Driver Interception**: Uses rustc's callback mechanism via `rustc_driver::Callbacks`
- **Stable MIR API**: Leverages the `stable_mir` crate for accessing compiler internals safely
- **Nightly Dependency**: Requires specific nightly toolchain (currently nightly-2024-11-29) for rustc_private features

### Data Flow Architecture

```
Rust Source Code → rustc compilation → MIR extraction → JSON serialization → Output File
                                          ↓
                                   SmirJson structure
                                          ↓
                                   Self-contained data with lookup tables
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Driver Module (`src/driver.rs`)
- **Purpose**: Provides compiler context and stable_mir API access
- **Implementation**: Custom `StableMirCallbacks` that implements `rustc_driver::Callbacks`
- **Hook Point**: `after_analysis` callback extracts MIR after type checking and analysis
- **API**: Single function `stable_mir_driver(args, callback_fn)` mimicking `rustc_internal::run_with_tcx!`

#### 2. Printer Module (`src/printer.rs`)
- **Core Data Structure**: `SmirJson<'t>` - the main serialization target
- **Components**:
  - `items`: Vector of compiled Rust functions broken into basic blocks
  - `types`: Type metadata with layout information 
  - `allocs`: Memory allocations and static data
  - `functions`: Link-time function mapping
  - `uneval_consts`: Unevaluated constant expressions
  - `spans`: Source location mapping
  - `machine`: Target machine information
  - `debug`: Optional debug information

#### 3. Graph Generation Module (`src/mk_graph.rs`)
- **Purpose**: Alternative output format as GraphViz dot files
- **Features**: Visualizes MIR items and basic blocks as call graphs
- **Usage**: Activated via `--dot` command line flag

#### 4. Cargo Integration (`src/bin/cargo_stable_mir_json.rs`)
- **Installation**: Creates `.stable_mir_json` directory with build artifacts
- **Integration**: Provides shell scripts that set RUSTC environment variable
- **Profile Support**: Handles both debug and release build configurations

## Data Model and Self-Containment

### Self-Contained JSON Design
The JSON output is designed to be completely self-contained, meaning it includes all necessary information to understand the MIR without requiring access to the original compiler context.

#### Lookup Tables Strategy
- **Problem**: `stable_mir` API provides access to data through function calls, not direct data structures
- **Solution**: Extract referenced data into lookup tables represented as `Vec<(Key, Value)>` pairs
- **Implementation**: Visitors traverse MIR structures to collect all referenced types, allocations, and constants

#### Current Limitations
- **Incomplete Type Extraction**: Not all types used in Rust programs are currently extracted (known issue)
- **External Crate References**: References to external crates are preserved but not fully expanded
- **Work in Progress**: The extraction process is actively being improved

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Test Framework
- **Golden Tests**: Compare generated JSON against expected output files
- **Normalization**: Uses `jq` filter to handle non-deterministic elements (hashes, IDs)
- **Test Cases**: Covers diverse Rust language features (closures, enums, recursion, etc.)
- **Failure Handling**: Separate directory for tests with known non-deterministic output

### Quality Assurance
- **Clippy Integration**: All code must pass `cargo clippy` without warnings
- **Formatting**: All code must pass `cargo fmt` without changes
- **Build Validation**: Uses `build.rs` to ensure correct toolchain and components

## External Dependencies and References

## Environment Variables and Configuration

- `LINK_INST`: Uses richer key structure for link-time functions map
- `DEBUG`: Serializes additional data and dumps logs to stdout
